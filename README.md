# Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor
Random Forest classifier model to predict the quality of wines based on various features.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about red wine samples, including features like acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content.
Identified and handled duplicate records in the dataset, ensuring data integrity.
Visualized the distribution of wine quality ratings using bar plots and catplots, providing insights into the dataset's quality distribution.
Explored the correlation between different features using a heatmap, revealing potential relationships between variables.
Prepared the data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Developed a Random Forest classifier model using scikit-learn, aiming to predict wine quality labels.
Achieved high accuracy scores of 99.68% on the test data and 100% on the training data, indicating the model's effectiveness.
Deployed the trained model to make predictions on new data, providing an example of classifying wine quality based on input features.
Demonstrated proficiency in Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
